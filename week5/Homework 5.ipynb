    "ANSWER: Furthest possible from zero means that the left side (which will have negative weight) will be closest to 0, while the right side (with positive weight) will be the closest to 1, or the other way around. In this case, the left side and right side of the circle is the furthest from zero, left side having negative number and right side having positive.\n",
